For remote connection to laptop (here MacBook Pro).
On: side button. Then press side/gront button to tool (top for tool menu) goto wifi then press gopro app (use fron button then top button to confirm).
Wifi starts flasing; goto laptop and looking for GoPro name (mine: obokhove) and connect password (gjtifs333 [is code so ask me]).
When connected go to system preferences -> Network -> wifi advanced; TCP/IP copy IP address in browser: 10.5.5.9:8080 (always same but check); see menu, click on "live, click on amba.m3u8, copy link in IO bar into movieplayer; e.g. go to QuickTime Player and open location: copy in the UP address (e.g. 10.5.5.9:8080/live/amba.m3u8) and you should be live broadcasting. If you stop the GoPro it is still live broadcasting so you can use the GoPro for safety given sufficient battery power' it works from quite a distance (10m tested).
